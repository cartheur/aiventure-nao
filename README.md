Work regarding and relating to Aldebaran's Nao Robot.

## Background

I purchased a Nao v4 in 2018 for 6k for the purposes of growing experience in [aeon](https://github.com/cartheur/aeon) software as the central point of my thesis is that it should be embodied to be able to achieve _some level_ of AGI. The results of this work were demonstrated in a series of [videos](https://cartheur.com/Products/Companion).

One of the most alarming aspects of my time with the robot was the complete lack of competence by their engineering and sales staff. I do not want to gripe about it but seeing as they have exchanged hands at least twice since my ownership of the robot tells tales. The new owners inherited the company's arrogance along with the IP. Hence, it was my notion to claim that _I_ owned the robot and not the company than manufactured it. Not sure what aspect of capitalism they are channeling or what fascist aspect tickles their fancy but _quid pro quo_ is the rule of the land, at least in the areas I have haunted.

It is a shame as a lot of thought and energy went into the design to compact in such a way as to make a wholesale usable device. In this regard I offer my respect. However, lockout features will not stop me from claiming the machine as my own. This repo is the story of freedom and how AGI can be realized with retail robots.
